# FishyCats
Fishy Cats is a casual mobile game, in which a cat catches fish! By selling these fish you have the opportunity to upgrade and increase your fish catching abilities.

Some of the project goals are; 
- to get a strong understanding of how UI works and interacts with other pieces in software,
- to create an interesting and polished project, 
- practice building scalable systems with lots of moving parts.


This project is currently in early beta. A large portion of the features have already been completed, although there are a few more things we want to add.


> **To try** an early build, download the latest release and run the exe! Included is a Windows build of the project, but the final version is intended for Android and iOS 

> **To play** click/tap anywhere on the screen to help your cat catch fish faster. Sell fish at the market, and use the money to buy upgrades so you can catch more fish, and make more money!
