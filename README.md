# FishyCats
Fishy Cats is a casual game, in which a cat catches fish! By selling these fish you have the opportunity to upgrade and increase your fish catching abilities.

Some of the project goals are; 
- to get a strong understanding of how UI works and interacts with other pieces in software,
- to create an interesting and polished project, 
- understand how to create scalable systems with lots of moving parts.


This project is currently in early beta. A large portion of the features have already been completed, although there are a few more things we want to add.
To try an early build, download the FishyCats Beta folder and run the exe!
